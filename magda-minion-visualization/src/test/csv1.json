                        "An extreme heatwave occurred in south-eastern Australia, January 1939. It was long lasting with very high temperatures. On 9 January the temperature at Kyancutta (South Australia) reached 49.3 &amp;deg;C, the highest temperature recorded in South Australia at that time.  Many temperature records were made during this heatwave, some of which have held until the recent 2009 heatwave; Adelaide, 46.1 &amp;deg;C, on 12 January, Melbourne, 45.6&amp;deg;C on 13 January, Sydney, 45.3&amp;deg;C on 14 January with Manly and Richmond both reaching over 47 &amp;deg;C. In northern New South Wales some places reached 48&amp;nbsp;&amp;deg;C on 15 January. Menindee in western New South Wales reached 49.7 &amp;deg;C.  High temperatures were experienced inland in 1939; at Mildura the temperature exceeded 37.8&amp;nbsp;&amp;deg;C on each of the first 14 days of January, and at the peak of the heatwave, averaged 45.6&amp;deg;C from 7-14 January. It is estimated that more than 400 deaths in Victoria were caused by excessive heat.  The strong northerly winds in 1939 over this period followed a very dry six months providing the right conditions for extreme bushfire, see the related entry for the 13 January 1939, Black Friday bushfire.",
                        "On 24 July 1979 an explosion occurred in the underground mine in Appin, a small town situated 35 km north-west of Wollongong. The explosion was caused by a rush of methane gas in the K panel which was a remote area of the mine situated 3 km below the surface.  There were 45 individuals working in the mine at the time of the explosion. A total of 14 people lost their lives; 10 miners were killed in the crib room, while another four were killed in other areas of the mine.",
                        "The summer of January 1939 was a period of extreme weather conditions across Australia. Scorching temperatures created ideal conditions for bushfires. The notorious &#39;Black Friday&#39; bushfires had a devastating impact on Victoria however, New South Wales was also badly affected by fire during the same period. The mercury reached 45.3C in Sydney and subsequent fires erupted across the state in towns including Port Hacking, Palm Beach, Nowra, Mittagong, Goulburn, Braidwood, Bega, Parramatta, Lidcombe, Bathurst, Windsor, Castle Hill, Pennant Hills, Petersham, Earlwood, Croydon, Katoomba and other areas around the Blue Mountains.  The bushfires had a devastating impact on infrastructure, including roads and railway lines. There was also a significant loss to farms and livestock and approximately fifty houses were completely destroyed by fire. Six individuals lost their lives as a direct result of the fires.  It was estimated that the 1939 damage was approximately &amp;pound;300,000.",
                        "On 5 April 1958 a pine plantation fire occurred in Wandilo, near Mount Gambier, where eight firefighters lost their lives. The fire started at 10.45 am and strong north, north-easterly winds forced the fire into nearby forests. Forestry and Emergency Fire Service units were dispatched and entered a clearing in the plantation. A fire storm developed and fire fighting crews were caught unprepared. Two forestry units were bogged in soft sand when trying to evacuate and another damaged a gearbox and could not move. Three people managed to survive in and out of the trucks but eight others died.  The fire was brought under control early the next day.",
                        "On 28 April 2006, a V/Line passenger train bound for Ararat with 36 passengers on board collided with a truck in Trawalla in country Victoria. The train&#39;s two carriages were derailed as a result of the high speed of the collision. Two people were killed and up to 20 passengers were injured. The crossing had a give way sign but no bells or boom gates. The State Government announced in early 2008 that the Trawalla crossing has been upgraded to feature boom barriers, flashing warning lights and audible warning bells.",
                        "Tropical Cyclone George formed on 3 March 2007 in the Joseph Bonaparte Gulf. By the time it crossed the coast, 50 km north-east of Port Hedland on 8 March, it had intensified from a Category 3 to a Category 5 tropical cyclone.  Winds generated by Tropical Cyclone George reached 154 km per hour at Port Hedland before the equipment failed. Temporary accommodation at a railway camp was severely damaged with some units breaking into pieces, causing greater damage. Of the 230 workers seeking shelter at the camp, which was 120 km south of Port Hedland, two died and 22 were injured. Damage was also reported at 3 mining camps, where 1000 people were cut off from rescuers by 275 km per hour winds.  An emergency situation was declared under the Emergency Management Act on 9 March to assist areas impacted by TC George, including the local government districts of Port Hedland, Roebourne and Ashburton.  Gas and oil production facilities in the region were closed for up to seven days as a result of the cyclone. The Insurance Council of Australia estimated the 2007 damage at $8 million, with the 2011 estimated normalised cost of $12 million.",
                        "On 31 October 2006 at Hexham in the Hunter Valley, a thunderstorm produced hail 4 cm in diameter. The hail damaged up to 10,000 motor vehicles and stripped leaves off trees.  At Wallsend a thunderstorm produced 4 cm hail, at Kahibah strong winds and 2 cm hail was reported and at New Lambton hail 3-4 cm in diameter was reported. The SES received more than 257 calls for assistance in the Newcastle city area.  The Insurance Council of Australia estimated the 2006 damage at $51 million, with the 2011 estimated normalised cost of $60 million.",
                        "On 5 June 2007 the V/Line passenger train 8042 was struck by a loaded semi - trailer at a level crossing on the Murray Valley Highway approximately six km north-west of Kerang. The train was en route from Swan Hill to Melbourne and the semi-trailer was on a regular freight run from Wangaratta Victoria to Adelaide South Australia. When the incident occurred the level crossings flashing lights and warning bells were operating.  The semi-trailer collided with the second passenger car of the three passenger car train. A large section of the body-side was torn away by the truck trailer and several seats on the right side of the car were torn from their mountings. The truck trailer then struck the front right corner of the third car breaching the occupied area. The draft yoke connecting the second and third cars fractured and the third car derailed both cars. Eleven train passengers died and a further 14 and the truck driver were injured.  The incident was reported by the train driver and others at the scene and the emergency service unit arrived on site at 1350 hours.  The Murray Valley Highway was opened to normal road traffic on 8 June 2007 and the rail line was re-opened on 12 June 2007.  A coroner&amp;rsquo;s inquest in 2013 resulted in 25 recommendations, including changes to level crossing warnings and emergency response procedures.   &amp;nbsp;",
                        "In late June 2007, the Gippsland area received record rainfall associated with an intense low pressure system. The substantial rain event followed the Great Divide Bushfires, when 1.2 million hectares of public and private land were burnt and large areas of soil were left exposed.   The storm in June 2007 resulted in major flooding and widespread damage. Seven rivers burst their banks causing millions of dollars of damage to homes, businesses and farms, as well as a significant loss of public and private assets. The rapidly rising floodwaters forced dozens of rescues and evacuations. One person died as a result of the flood waters. During 48 hours of torrential rain more than 1000 emergency service staff worked to save homes and shops in towns throughout Gippsland. Relief centres were set up at Bairnsdale, Lakes Entrance, Paynesville, Sale, Lucknow and Loch Sport and housed up to 360 evacuees. Volunteers also provided medical aid and catering with other organisations such as the Lions Club.  The State Government established a Flood Recovery Ministerial Taskforce, which assessed community need and planned the recovery program. The Taskforce announced a $60 million Flood Recovery Initiative covering among other things the cost of work on some 400 roads, bridges and 80 walking tracks spanning hundreds of km and clearing debris from the regions&amp;rsquo; water supplies, catchments and recreation areas.  The Insurance Council of Australia estimated the 2007 damage at $15 million, with the 2011 estimated normalised cost of $18 million.",
                        "On 22 September 2007 a historical department store in Hobart was destroyed by fire. The fire started in the Liverpool Street store between the first and second floors. The building consisted of four trading floors and was one of the largest department stores in Hobart. The building was successfully evacuated and there were no deaths or significant injuries. When the fire was at its worst, approximately 90 firefighters from Hobart and surrounding areas, more than 60 police and a number of ambulance crews were in attendance.  The roof of the Liverpool Street store collapsed and the structural damage was such that the remaining four walls had to be demolished to avoid damage to neighbouring buildings. Significant damage occurred to the contents of surrounding stores.  The Tasmanian Fire Service assessed the damage to&amp;nbsp;the store&amp;nbsp;and the surrounding businesses to cost in the vicinity of $50 million.",
                        "On 8 October 2007 a super-cell thunderstorm with large hailstones the size of tennis balls hit Lismore at 1.50 pm causing chaos in the central business district. There was extensive damage to central Lismore as a result of the large hail and strong winds. South Lismore was hit again on 9 October by hail 6 cm in diameter and strong winds estimated at 100 km per hour, which caused widespread damage. Approximately 20 mm rain fell in 10 minutes. Seventeen people were injured by hail or flying glass from smashed windows. Homes and motor vehicles were damaged, trees were uprooted by flash flooding and there were many power outages. Buildings were damaged including City Hall, the police station, ambulance station, hospital and other council buildings as well as small businesses.  There were approximately 300 calls for assistance received by the SES.  The Insurance Council of Australia estimated the 2006 damage at $97 million, with the 2011 estimated normalised cost of $109 million.",
                        "At approximately 10.30 pm, on 23 March 2004, a hose attachment was made between the process water and the clean water pipe system in the Ranger ore processing facility, near Kakadu National Park. Early the following day, workers showering after the night shift complained of skin irritation and poor quality drinking water. There were also reports of nausea, stomach cramps and vomiting from drinking contaminated water. Energy Resources Australia (ERA) admitted there were at least 28 workers that either drank or showered in water that had 400 times the legal dose of uranium.  Initial testing by ERA indicated that the water had a mild acidic ph of 4.5 and an elevated uranium content of eight parts per million. In response to this incident, ERA decided to close down both the clean water and process water systems, send non-essential staff home and conduct an orderly shutdown of the mine and all processing facilities.  A report by the Department of Environment and Heritage concluded that the primary cause of the contamination of the potable water system at the Ranger mine was that an operator opened a valve connecting the water manifold at the Fine Ore Bin (FOB) Scrubber to a one inch hose. At the time of this connection, the manifold was also connected to the process water system. Unknown to this operator, the other end of the one inch hose was connected to the potable water system and the valve at that end of the hose was open. The higher pressure in the process water system caused water to flow from the process water system into the potable water supply system.",
                        "On 29 October 2004, a package dropped in a loading bay at a Tullamarine freight depot released toxic vapours. The solution, containing hydrochloric and formic acid, formed a smoky haze after the spill, and caused the evacuation of 400 workers and injuries to 28 people. Most of the injured sustained respiratory irritation, nausea and vomiting.",
                        "On 3 November 1927 the Greycliffe, a wooden screw steamer ferry, sank quickly when it was hit and cut in two by the liner Tahiti off Bradley&#39;s Head, Sydney Harbour.  A few passengers were able to jump to safety but the ferry sank in a matter of seconds. Rescue craft were deployed and saved some people, however the 7000 ton liner swept unchecked through the wreckage drowning more and injuring others. It is estimated more than 40 died but the exact number is unknown.",
                        "On 23 June 1998, severe storms with gale force winds affected the Northern tablelands and Hunter Valley regions of Sydney, causing damage to properties and infrastructure. Fallen power lines created a power outage for over 7000 homes and demand for power reached record levels on the night of 23 June.  The State Emergency Service reported that across the State more than 2000 requests for assistance had been received; almost 1800 of which were received from the Hunter Valley. The worst affected areas were Lake Macquarie, Maitland, Newcastle and Port Stephens.  One woman drowned in flooded waters at Crookwell.  The Insurance Council of Australia estimated the 1998 damage at $12 million, with the 2011 estimated normalised cost of $39 million.&amp;lt;",
                        "On 18 March 1990, a hailstorm spread from Camden south-west of Sydney to Narrabeen Beach on Sydney&#39;s northern region. The hail measured up to 8 cm and caused severe damage to approximately 14,000 homes and businesses and 9000 motor vehicles. Winds reached 109 km per hour at Bankstown. Nine kilometres of power lines were brought down and roads were closed from flash flooding. The State Emergency Service received more than 3500 calls for help in the first two days after the storm with assistance being provided to approximately 2000 homes. Twenty-five people sustained serious injury.  The Insurance Council of Australia estimated the 1999 damage at $319 million, with the 2011 estimated normalised cost of $1297 million.",
                        "On 19 January 1997, temperatures soared above 40 &amp;deg;C and northerly winds were gusting at 70 km per hour contributing to two damaging bushfires near Melbourne. The fires in Mt Eliza burnt two homes and evacuations were required at Mt Martha, Arthur&#39;s Seat and the Mornington Peninsula. Approximately 250 bushfires burnt areas of Victoria on 21 January, a 41.2 &amp;deg;C day. The worst affected areas were Ferny Creek, Upwey and Kalorama in the Dandenong Ranges where it took 1,500 firefighters and six water-bombing aircraft to control the 3,700 ha forest blaze. In addition to the two houses at Mt Eliza, 41 houses were destroyed and 45 damaged in the Dandenongs. Three people died (at Ferny Creek) and approximately 40 were injured throughout the State.  The Insurance Council of Australia estimated the 1997 damage at $10 million, with the 2011 estimated normalised cost of $29 million.",
                        "On 10 April 1860 the Rembrandt, a wooden barque, left Newcastle and met westerly gales that carried away most of her sail. It was also swamped by huge waves resulting in several major leaks. Six days later the boat began to settle and sank off Ninety Mile Beach in eastern Victoria on the Gippsland coast. Ten people drowned.",
                        "Tropical Cyclone Winifred registered as a category three cyclone and recorded wind gusts up to 175 km per hour, near Cowley Beach south of Innisfail. Damage and disruption extended from north of Cairns to Cardwell and inland on a narrow front to Ravenshoe. The areas that suffered flooding were between Babinda and Tully.  The tide gauge at Clump Point recorded a storm surge of 1.6 m, wave run-up on beaches was approximately 2 m above the astronomical tide. Significant 24 hour rainfalls during the period were Topaz 304 mm, Ravenshoe 373 mm, Tully 212 mm, lnnisfail 221 mm and Babinda 251 mm. There were three deaths.  The Insurance Council of Australia estimated the 1986 damage at $40 million, with the 2011 estimated normalised cost of $205 million.",
                        "In late March 2002 a large outbreak of food poisoning was reported in Melbourne. More than 272 people sought medical care, with 15 being admitted to hospital. The onset of gastroenteritis was within one to four hours after consumption of a meal of rice, lamb and potatoes served at a New Year festival. The cause of the outbreak was believed to be inadequate storage and handling of leftover food.",

                        "On 18 April 1990 after several weeks of heavy rain over Queensland, a strong upper level low dumped upwards of 150 mm of rain with exceptional totals to 350 mm across large areas of central Queensland over a three day period. Already saturated catchments were inundated and major flooding quickly developed on the Warrego and Maranoa Rivers and many other inland systems. The towns of Jericho and Augathella were flooded and a section of the Longreach railway was washed away.  On the morning of 21 April, the Warrego River was rising rapidly. Later the same day the river peaked at over 8.5 m which was 1.5 m above the previous record. Levee banks protecting the town were ineffective and floodwaters spread through the town, necessitating the entire population of 3500 to be evacuated to the airport. Many residents climbed to their rooftops and had to be rescued by helicopter.  The low then moved south-east and torrential rains were experienced across large areas of New South Wales west of the Divide. There was major flooding on the Lachlan, Macquarie and Castlereagh Rivers, among others. The Bogan river flooded into Nyngan. Despite the residents&#39; ttempts to raise the levee banks by sand bagging, the levees could not withstand the flood and on the 23 April, as the river surged to 5.2 m, nearly one metre higher than the previous record, most of the town was inundated. The population of 2500 was evacuated to Dubbo, 160 km away.  The low then moved towards Victoria and produced torrential rains over Gippsland on 20 and 21 April with up to 350 mm recorded over the two day period. Major flooding occurred on the Thomson, Avon and Mitchell Rivers. Hectares of vegetable crops were destroyed by flood waters and highways cut. People were evacuated from low-lying areas. It total 150 homes were flooded.  Property losses from the three-state flood were considerable.Towns and houses flooded, infrastructure was destroyed or damaged, thousands of sheep and cattle drowned and thousands of hectares of ruined crops.  The floods claimed six lives.  The Insurance Council of Australia estimated the 1990 damage at $30 million with the 2011 estimated normalised cost of $99 million.",

                        "On 15 February 2001, at approximately 11.00 pm, a fire occurred at a hazardous waste and solvent recycling facility in Bellevue, Western Australia. The facility was estimated to have been storing up to 500,000 litres of chemicals and toxic solvents, largely those used in the motor vehicle and dry-cleaning industries. The combustion of stored toxic waste together with flammable material contributed to the creation of a dense toxic smoke plume.  The fire was one of the biggest hazardous materials fire in Australian history. More than 2,000,000 litres of water were applied to extinguish the fire and over 350 FESA personnel, including volunteers, responded to the emergency.  It took more than two days to extinguish the fire and 50 people were evacuated.  The fire destroyed the majority of chemicals stored on the site and also burnt bushland down to the Helena River. Initial clean-up costs were approximately $5.6 million.Toxic fumes were discharged into the atmosphere and residue from the fire landed in surrounding areas and covered buildings and vehicles in the vicinity that subsequently had to be decontaminated. Public health concerns were raised about a range of experiences of exposure to contaminants emanating from the fire.  Hundreds of thousands of litres of contaminated water had to be pumped from drains after the fire and all drains had to be thoroughly decontaminated.  A specialised drum shredding and waste collection machine was designed and constructed. Six months after the fire, the drums were processed and the waste encased in concrete, painted in impervious paint and disposed of in a class four land fill.  The fire also held economic impacts as the company received the majority of Perth&#39;s hazardous liquid wastes and the only other facility was shut down by the government in 2003. Consequently, waste had to be transported at least 800 km for disposal. Bellevue property values were affected and increased regulation of hazardous waste and chemical industries was introduced.  A Health Register was established under the guidance of a Steering Committee following a recommendation from the Bellevue Hazardous Waste Fire Parliamentary Inquiry. The First Report found that of the 218 people that elected to be part of the Bellevue Health Surveillance Register, 60 per cent reported at least one symptom that they thought was related to the fire but most symptoms did not last long. Typical symptoms included sore eyes, coughs, colds, chest complaints, dizziness, vomiting, nausea and headache.  Due to the hazardous nature of the site, a proper scene examination and the origin and cause of the fire could not be established. Furthermore, the fire destroyed most evidence and the immediate clean-up removed any other evidence there may have been. Thus the cause of the fire has never been determined.",

Temperatures varied between high thirties and mid forties over most of eastern South Australia and Victoria with relative humidity generally less than 15 per cent.  The Victorian bushfire season had started in November 1982. There were 854 bushfires reported at this time including, Ballan, Mount Macedon on 1 February, Cann River and Mount Donna Buang.  On early Ash Wednesday morning there were 104 fires already burning in Victoria most controlled or contained, it was only after 2.00 pm that the situation exploded.  The Victorian fires formed several complexes.  1. Western district near Warrnambool. This fire started from a defective private power line. The resulting fire front was kilometres wide and moving at frightening speed. A cool change came through at 5.00 pm and the wind changed to the south-west. The fire headed toward the town of Terang. The fire passed the town to its north and was brought under control the next day. In total nine people died, 50,000 hectares burnt, 157 houses destroyed and 19,300 livestock was lost.  Another person died near Branxholme from a smaller fire caused by power line fault.  2. East Trentham&amp;nbsp;- Macedon fire complex. This fire began around 2.00 pm near East Trentham due to two powerlines touching and sparking. The fire moved to the Wombat State Forest and burnt much of Bullengarook. The fire stalled for a while but upon wind change to the south-west the fire picked up again and headed toward Woodend with a 7 m fire front at 8.30 pm. It reached Macedon where people and animals sheltered in the Hotel protected by volunteers. The rest of the town was annihilated. After reaching the top of Mount Macedon it was controlled in an area that was previously burnt on 1 February. Seven people died, 20,000 hectares burnt, 200 homes destroyed in Macedon, 150 on Mount Macedon, 50 in Bullengarook and 20 in Woodend.  3. Otways complex. The fire broke out approximately 3.00 pm at Deans Marsh and moved toward Lorne eventually onto the ridges above the town on and down to the sand dunes with many people taking refuge in the sea. The fire moved to Aireys Inlet where the fibro houses were hit by walls of flame and a gigantic firestorm. The fire moved at extraordinary speed and next hit was Anglesea, where houses were lost but the main part of town was saved. The fire burnt on through the night toward Jan Juc and Torquay and was eventually contained early morning near Bellbrae. Three people were killed and 578 houses and other buildings were lost.  4. Upper Beaconsfield - Cockatoo complex. This fire began in Belgrave Heights south of Mount Dandenong. Half an hour later 10 km away, a fire started in Cockatoo and remained static until later that night. The first fire moved 15 km toward Berwick and Pakenham and firefighters were just beginning to gain control when the wind change came through at 8.30 pm redirecting the fire towards Upper Beaconsfield. Firefighters were caught in terrible circumstances leading to deaths. The Cockatoo fire began to flare at 7.30 pm. The fire went right through the town of Cockatoo as fire trucks had been called away to other fires. There were reports of women and children being sheltered and saved at a local kindergarten. The kindergarden&amp;nbsp;building was later&amp;nbsp;recorded by Heritage Victoria as a building of significance to be protected.&amp;nbsp;In total, 27 people died, 100 were injured and 535 houses and buildings destroyed.  5.

The flight departed Albany airport at 0901 hours and it is believed the accident occurred between 0920 and 0925 hours.  The pilot was conducting a low-level inspection of the area in question to aid the inspection. The pilot was flying the aircraft in a steep, right turn at a slow speed. During the turn both engines lost power. As no fuel blockages were found, the most probable reason for the loss of power is a prolonged, unbalanced, right turn stopped the fuel feed to the right fuel sump from the right main tank. In less than three minutes, all useable fuel in the sump had been consumed and the engine stopped.  The loss of power led to a loss of control and the pilot was unable to recover the situation prior to impact.  All four people on the plane died in the accident.",

At approximately 2 am, 378 Japanese prisoners armed themselves with improvised weapons including clubs, bats and sharpened mess knifes. They breached the perimeter subsequently escaping. This was the first and only escape of its kind on Australian soil.  A Military Court of Inquiry investigated the incident, and a summary of its findings was read to the House of Representatives by Prime Minister John Curtin on 8 September 1944. The inquiry drew several conclusions from the incident. Firstly, conditions at the camp were fully in accordance with the International Convention. Secondly, no complaints regarding treatment had been made by or on behalf of the Japanese prior to the incident. Thirdly, the actions of the Australian garrison in resisting the attack averted greater loss of life, and that firing ceased as soon as control was assured. Finally, many of the dead had died by suicide or by the hand of other prisoners, and that many of the wounded had suffered self-inflicted wounds.  The incident lasted 10 days and resulted in the death of 231 Japanese prisoners with a further 108 wounded. Four Australian soldiers were killed in the event with two being posthumously awarded the George Cross, the highest civil decoration for heroism. A Japanese war cemetery was established by agreement with the Japanese government in 1964.

                        "The Mount Mulligan Mine incident occurred on 19 September 1921. The mine was known as a safe mine, as there was no detectable gas in the shafts. As a result miners worked with naked flames in light instead utilising safety lamps. This caused an explosion and claimed 75 lives.  A Royal Commission was established to investigate the incident. The findings discovered the explosion was caused by a fire damp (flammable gas found in coal mines) in combination with explosives which were stored, distributed and carried underground in a careless manner.",
                        "The Federation Drought began in 1895 and reached its peak in 1901 and 1902.  During the drought river systems across the nation suffered, notably the Darling River which virtually ran dry at Bourke, New South Wales. In Victoria, the Murray River ran dry through the towns of Mildura, Balranald and Deniliquin causing river transport to suffer or cease.  Except for Queensland, most parts of the nation received reasonable rain in 1900 and early 1901, however very dry weather set in again across eastern Australia during spring 1901. The drought broke mid December 1902 when heavy rain fell in Victoria. Rain extended to New South Wales and southern Queensland, while northern Queensland had reasonable falls from December onwards.  Economic depression and labour strikes added to the affect of the drought. As a result of the drought sheep and cattle numbers fell from 91 to 54 million, and 11.8 to 7 million respectively. Rabbit numbers increased to plague proportions, resulting in some farmers losing everything and walking away from their properties.",

                        "Drought conditions prevailed over eastern Australia from 1937 to 1945. They first emerged at serious levels in 1937, with New South Wales, Victoria, much of Queensland and parts of Western Australia affected. Isolated parts of New South Wales, notably in the central west, suffered record low rainfall. In 1938 there was further deterioration in New South Wales and Victoria and it also spread to eastern South Australia and the south-west grain growing region of Western Australia where wheat yields plummeted to their lowest level since 1914.  In Victoria, a very dry six month period provided the right conditions for the disastrous Black Friday bushfires in January 1939. Heavy rain fell in late February 1939 over Victoria, South Australia and New South Wales, and for the remainder of the year abundant rain fell over eastern and central Australia. However dry weather occurred again and 1940 was one of the driest years of the century over most of the southern parts of the country. Dams were empty in New South Wales and Brisbane had water restrictions. January 1941 saw rain again, but by the second half of that year was again very dry. The following 12 months were good for general rain, but again dry conditions returned in 1943, and were worse again in 1944 when a failure of the wheat crop occurred in several places. The drought continued into 1945 and large rivers such as the Hunter were virtually dry. By April 1945 most Victorian water storage facilities were empty, the Murray river ceased flow at Echuca and Adelaide faced water shortages.  Financial losses were severe during this drought. The number of sheep that died in 1945 alone was 10 million in New South Wales. In 1946 Queensland financial losses caused by the drought were estimated at &amp;pound;25 million. Approximately four million sheep died in South Australia over 1944 and 1945.  The drought finally ended in the southern states during the winter of 1945 but continued into 1946 in northern New South Wales and southern Queensland. In 1947 significant rainfall ended the long drought.",

The gunman then killed a further 15 people within Port Arthur and the nearby region and injured 21 others. He secured himself in a local guest house for a period while police attempted negotiations. The gunman then set fire to the building and later emerged, with burn injuries, to be taken into police custody. There was a significant coordinated multi-agency emergency response to the event including Tasmania Police, Tasmanian Ambulance Service, Tasmania Fire Service, State Emergency Service Tasmania and other agencies. Approximately 690 emergency service personnel were involved in the response. The Royal Hobart Hospital also activated emergency procedures to manage the large number of injured victims. Considerable recovery operations were undertaken to assist the thousands of people affected by the event. A large number of additional government and non-government agencies assisted operations. The economic impact of the massacre at Tasmania&#39;s most popular tourist attraction was substantial, including physical restoration of impacted sites, counselling and compensation, loss of tourism revenue and the flow on loss of jobs to the Tasman Peninsula.  &amp;nbsp;",

In the town of Avoca the river was measured at approximately 17 m above the average summer level. When the waters finally receded, the railway station had disappeared, railway tracks were undermined and twisted, bridges were destroyed and debris blocked the railway line. Many road bridges in the north and north-east were lost.  On the north coast most rivers were severely flooded. At Gawler, near Ulverstone, a truck crashed through a bridge into a flooded river, drowning eight people.  In the Tamar Valley flood waters caused the river to rise to record levels. Flood waters passed through Cataract Gorge and combined with floodwaters from the North Esk, inundated more than 1,000 houses in the low-lying parts of Launceston. Some 3,500 people were evacuated. The power station at Duck Reach was washed away.  In southern Tasmania the rain was substantial and caused rivers to flow across roads and many livestock were lost.

The immediate effects of the fires included reduced water quality and quantity, loss of vegetation and habitats, destruction of commercial timber infrastructure, damage to recreation and tourism infrastructure assets and destruction of cultural sites and farms adjacent to public land.  A Ministerial Taskforce, appointed by the Victorian Premier, announced a funding package of $70.6 million for recovery works on public land associated with natural and cultural assets and support for agricultural private landowners affected by the fires. This was the biggest bushfire recovery effort ever undertaken in Victoria at the time. The Bushfire Recovery Program for the environment and agriculture focused on four areas:  1. Asset repair or replacement in parks, forests and alpine resorts ($24.9 million)  2. Protection and restoration of water catchments and water supply ($23.9 million)  3. Restoration of ecological and cultural heritage values ($13.2 million)  4. Providing practical assistance for affected farm enterprises ($8.6 million) Assets lost or damaged included; 41 houses, 213 other structures, three bridges and 10,000 livestock.  The Insurance Council of Australia estimated the 2003 damage for Victoria and New South Wales at $12 million, with the 2011 estimated normalised cost of $24 million.",
                        "On 24 August 2003, a windstorm developed from an intense low pressure system over Tasmania and was felt along the eastern states from Victoria to New South Wales.  Tasmania  Tasmanian police removed trees blown on to roads by the strong winds on the Murchison Highway in Roseberry on the west coast, and a tree was moved off the Tasman Highway in Buckland on the east coast . Falling trees across power lines cut electricity to the Tasman Peninsula between Sorell and Nubeena.  Rain caused flooding over an extensive area of southern Tasmania and damaged the Buckland Bridge in Orford, which connects the east coast to the Midlands, to the point where it had to be closed for two days.  Police received approximately 400 calls for assistance, the majority from people in the Tasman Peninsula, Bruny Island, the Huon Valley and the east coast.  New South Wales  Sydney and Illawarra districts experienced gale force winds causing considerable damage to trees, boats, aircraft, buildings and power loss to 150,000 homes. Wind gusts reached 141 km per hour at Bellambi Point, 120 km per hour at Albion Park, Manly and Kurnell, 113 km per hour at Sydney Airport and 109 km per hour at Fort Denison. A man died when a tree fell on his car in St Ives. Three people were injured by falling trees in Mosman and Bathurst and another after falling from a roof in Wollongong. Two swimmers were apparently lost when they were blown out to sea off Curl Curl.  Australian Capital Territory  In Canberra strong winds tore roof tiles off houses, uprooted trees and brought down power lines. Canberra Airport reported a maximum wind gust of 93 km per hour.  Victoria  Heavy rain and strong winds caused trees to fall damaging several houses and cutting off major roads across Melbourne and in the north-east of the state, with the State Emergency Service responding to more than 1,500 calls for help.

                        "At the beginning of February 2005 a low pressure system brought severe storms to eastern Australia. The weather system resulted in record rainfalls to south-east Australia and abnormally low temperatures through much of the eastern half of the country.  New South Wales  On 2 February, many areas of New South Wales and suburban Sydney experienced hail and heavy rain. Some examples are:    Kellyville, hail 5 cm,  Blacktown, hail 4 cm,  Kings Langley, hail 3 cm,  Quakers Hill, hail 3 cm,  Greystanes, heavy rain and hail 4 cm,  Potts Hill, hail 2-3 cm,  Castle Hill, hail 4-5 cm,  Greenacre, hail 4-5 cm,  St Ives, heavy rain and hail 2 cm,  Wahroona, heavy rain and hail 3 cm,  Gosford, hail 4 cm and Terrigal hail 4-5 cm.    Flash flooding was seen in Bexley (metropolitan Sydney) and in North Ryde. A thunderstorm and possible tornado caused severe local wind damage, bringing down trees and power lines, resulting in power outages to thousands of homes.  The strongest wind gusts during the storm were felt at Bathurst with 93 km per hour, Scone 93 km per hour, Kurnell 94 km per hour and Newcastle 91 km per hour.  The unseasonal cold weather brought snow to some areas of New South Wales where approximately 10-15 cm snow fell in the Snowy Mountains and temperatures reached as low as minus 5&amp;deg;C. On the Brindabella Ranges near Canberra and on the Southern Tablelands, several centimetres of snow settled on the ground. Record low maximum and minimum temperatures occurred over this period, especially in the southern areas of the state.  Victoria  Substantial rainfall was reported in many areas of Victoria with 24 hour rainfall totals exceeding 150 mm in many places. Rainfall in the Melbourne metropolitan area exceeded 100 mm with an all time 24 hour record for Melbourne set at 120.2 mm (the previous record was 108 mm).  The highest wind gusts were recorded at Wilson&#39;s Promontory with gusts of up to 148 km per hour. In the Melbourne area wind gusts to 104 km per hour were recorded at Fawkner and Beacon.  Extensive damage to buildings was reported and over 7000 requests for assistance were received by the SES and other emergency services over the following days.  Tasmania  During this storm, Tasmania experienced widespread damage particularly from wind gusts. The strong south easterly winds caused damage from Devonport to Bridport, Scottsdale and Winnaleah in the north-east, Binalong Bay on the East Coast, and to Flinders Island in Bass Strait. Port Sorell (near Devonport) reported many homes to be badly damaged in part due to falling trees.  Approximately 25 yachts in the Tamar River broke their moorings, with 14 reportedly destroyed, causing hundreds of thousands of dollars damage.  The Bass Strait ferry Spirit of Tasmania l was forced to return to Melbourne after sustaining damage in seas estimated at 20 m. The Spirit of Tasmania II was delayed on its voyage from Devonport to Melbourne, while the Spirit of Tasmania III broke its moorings in Devonport and was also slightly damaged.  Fruit crops sustained up to 50 per cent loss; particularly apple and pear growers. Damage was also sustained to poppy and grain crops.  Strong winds battered Tasmania during this storm, some examples are; Mount Wellington 104 km per hour, Mount Read 93 km per hour, Eddystone Point 117 km per hour, Flinders Island Airport 100 km per hour, Launceston Airport 94 km per hour and Cape Bruny on Bruny Island 91 km per hour.  On 3 February substantial rainfall accompanied the storm and flooding occurred in several areas on the east coast, some suburbs of Hobart and in the south-east. The Browns River at Kingston broke its banks causing local flooding with several minor landslides also reported in the area.  South Australia  Gale force winds of up to 67 km per hour occurred at several locations in South Australia during this storm event. These occurred in Marree and briefly at Hindmarsh Island.  The Insurance Council of Australia estimated the 2005 damage for the combined states at $216.7 million, with the estimated 2011 normalised cost of $304 million.",
                        "On 2 April 2005, a Royal Australian Navy (RAN) Sea King helicopter from HMAS Kanimbla crashed on the Indonesian island of Nias when approaching the village of Amandraya, at approximately 7:30 pm (Australian Eastern Standard Time).  The aircrew and seven members of the Australian Defence Force Joint Medical Element were undertaking an operation to provide humanitarian relief and medical treatment to the victims of the earthquake of 28 March 2005 off the west coast of Sumatra.  Of the 11&amp;nbsp;military personnel on board, nine were killed in the accident. Two injured personnel underwent treatment on board the Kanimbla.  A report into the crash found the main reason for the accident was that a nut and split pin in the helicopter&#39;s flight controls were incorrectly fitted. It also found that the squadron responsible for the helicopter&#39;s maintenance routinely took shortcuts. The Department of Defence advises it implemented all 256 recommendations from the report, including aviation maintenance regulations and a major review of airworthiness.",
                        "An explosion occurred at one of three gas plants operated by Esso at Longford. The fires caused by the explosion burned for two days, and many Victorian&#39;s were left without gas for 19 days.  The rupture led to the release of vapours and liquid.  The last fires were extinguished at 5.30 pm on 27 September.  It is estimated that 1.4 million households and 89,000 businesses were affected, costing approximately $1.3 billion.  Two Esso employees were killed by the explosion and eight sustained serious injury. On 12 October 1998, the Victorian Government announced a Royal Commission into the incident.",
                        "On the morning of Sunday 26 December 2004, a massive earthquake measuring 9.0 on the Richter scale struck Indonesia off the west coast of northern Sumatra. The epicentre was 30 km under the seabed and approximately 250 km south to south-west of Banda Aceh.&amp;nbsp;In the nine hours following the enormous earthquake, 14 aftershocks with magnitudes between 5.7 and 7.3 occurred along the arc from Sumatra towards Nicobar and the Andaman Islands. Over a hundred aftershocks were recorded. The quakes triggered powerful tsunamis towering 10 m in height that moved through the Indian Ocean region at over 500 km per hour. The tsunami waves caused widespread death and injuries, displaced thousands, destroyed towns, homes, livelihoods, infrastructure, and wrecked coastal areas. The worst affected countries were India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Maldives, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Seychelles, Thailand and Somalia. Bangladesh, Kenya and Australia also absorbed some of the effect of the tsunami. Financial losses in the Maldives represented approximately 45 per cent of its gross domestic product (GDP), while Indonesia suffered $4.5 billion in economic losses, representing the entire GDP of the Aceh Province. The overall financial impact on the Indonesian economy lowered the projected growth by approximately 0.2 per cent in 2005. Geoscience Australia stated the earthquake was the result of plate collision at the boundary of two tectonic plates, creating a large fault or offset on the ocean floor. The displacement of the ocean floor which generated the sea wave or tsunami, which spread from the epicentre across the Indian Ocean, was the largest recorded in 40 years.  The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent estimated the loss of life:    Dead 273,636 (220,153 in Indonesia alone)  Missing 7,253 (estimated)  Displaced 1,590,707 (estimated)  Homeless 507,496 (estimated)    Twenty six Australians lost their lives.  The Australian Government committed more than $1 billion to the relief efforts. The Australian community also rallied together to raise approximately $235 million to help tsunami victims.",

                        "A hailstorm brought about by unusual weather conditions created widespread flooding and significant damage to the city of Brisbane. The cause of the extreme weather was a vast difference between the ground temperature and a below freezing stratosphere temperature, combined with damp air situated on the coast.  Hail was reported as being 15 cm deep across roads in some areas. There was significant damage to buildings and cars. Over 200 lightning strikes were recorded and as a result Brisbane Airport was required to close for an hour until the storm subsided. Approximately 6500 properties lost power and the SES responded to 160 calls, caused by flooding waters, fallen power lines and trees.

Consequently, heavy rain occurred over a large part of the north-east region during the period 19-23 May, with additional heavy falls on 20-21 May. This was the third major flood to occur in the Mid North Coast this year, compounding damage previously caused during the February and April floods.  Damage recorded in the region included winds of 130 km per hour at Byron Bay, closure of 240 schools, the Tweed area affected by a lightning strike disabling powerlines to the north and south of the region (12,000 homes and businesses), 16,000 people on the far north coast were without power overnight, 35,000 people isolated by floodwaters, an overall approximate 21,500 people isolated in the affected regions, and the Macleay River levee at Kempsey broke its banks inundating the township.

Because of the speed the virus spread around the world and the fact that it was a new strain of flu, the World Health Organization declared it a pandemic in June 2009. This H1N1 influenza strain is referred to as both &#39;pandemic flu&#39; and &#39;swine flu&#39;.  The first case of this new pandemic strain of flu in Australia was in May 2009. By February 2010 there were over 5000 people hospitalised and nearly 200 deaths due to pandemic flu. Reports indicate that most of those who died had underlying medical conditions, including cancer, diabetes mellitus and morbid obesity. The median age of death was 53 years, compared to the median age of death from seasonal flu from 2001 to 2006, which was 83 years.  The then Minister for Health and Ageing, Nicola Roxon, announced in a media release that as of 1 December 2010 Australia&#39;s Pandemic Phase moved from PROTECT to ALERT which signified the end of the H1N1 influenza pandemic in Australia. The Department of Health and Ageing reported that there were 44,403 confirmed cases of swine flu in Australia since May 2009, including 6767 in 2010.

Approximately 153 staff were evacuated from the plant. Nobody was injured, but the facilities were forced to close temporarily.  The incident caused Western Australia&#39;s domestic gas supply to be cut by 30 per cent, as the Varanus Island facility is a major exporter of gas to the mainland. The largest impact was felt by major industry partners of Apache Energy such as BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto and Burrup Fertilisers, but the disruption in gas supplies also affected small businesses. A survey by the Western Australia Chamber of Commerce and Industry found that of 300 businesses surveyed, almost half said they had been affected by the energy shortage.  The West Australian Government laid claims against Apache Northwest Pty Ltd and its co-licencees, Kufpec Australia Pty Ltd and Tap (Harriet) Pty Ltd for &#39;failing to maintain a pipeline in good condition and repair&#39;.

                        "At approximately 3 pm on 28 December 2007, a fire began on the north side of the Great Eastern Highway, 80 km west of Coolgardie. It was a hot, dry and windy day, with Southern Cross and Kalgoorlie registering maximum temperatures of 37.4 &amp;deg;C and 41.7 &amp;deg;C, creating extreme fire weather conditions. The fire spread rapidly in a northerly direction in the Boorabbin National Park.  On 30 December 2007, a strong northerly wind change caused breakaways from the containment lines and the fire crossed the Great Eastern Highway from north to south. Roadblocks were established; however several escorted convoys of vehicles were permitted to travel through the fire area.  A convoy of vehicles from Coolgardie arriving at the eastern side of the fire, without an escort, drove into the fire area. Several trucks were engulfed in flames, resulting in three deaths.  The highway remained closed until containment lines were completed and a fall-back strategy was implemented on 9 January 2008. The final size of the fire was 39,630 ha.  An inquiry into the deaths found three dominating causes - the expectations of fire behaviour in shrubland fuels at night; the procedures for managing road blocks; and the strategic assessment of the fire&#39;s potential; but concluded that there were many complex, interacting contributing factors and extenuating circumstances that lead to the incident outcomes.",

In total, 33 people lost their lives in flood and cyclone events and three people were still listed missing as of March 2012.  On 25 December 2010, Cyclone Tasha crossed the northern Queensland coast and brought disaster to every river system south of the Tropic of Capricorn and as far west as Longreach and Charleville.  The flooding engulfed Alpha, Jericho, Chinchilla, Dalby, Theodore, Warwick, Bundaberg, Gayndah, Munduberra, Emerald, Rockhampton, Condamine and St George. The Condamine River, the Balonne River, the Burnett River, the Comet River, the Dawson River and the Nagoa River reached flood peaks never before recorded.  On 10 January 2011 a wall of water swept through Toowoomba, then travelled west, flooding Oakey, Dalby, Chinchilla and Condamine for a second time, causing flooding through the Lockyer Valley, including Murphy&amp;rsquo;s Creek, Postman&amp;rsquo;s Ridge, Helidon, Grantham, Laidley, Lowood, Fernvale and Forrest Hill.  The floodwaters affected the Bremer, Lockyer and Brisbane River systems, reaching heights that engulfed Ipswich, Goodna, Gailes, Karalee and suburbs of Brisbane.  During this period approximately 3572 businesses were inundated.  There were 5900 people evacuated from 3600 homes. Commercial loss was approximately $4 billion across the mining, agriculture and tourism sectors. Nineteen thousand kilometres of roads were damaged. Three major ports were significantly affected. More than 28 per cent of the Queensland rail network was left twisted and displaced. An estimated 28,000 homes would need to be rebuilt while vast numbers of dwellings require extensive repairs.  The judicial inquiry into Queensland&#39;s floods started on 10 February 2011, a final report was published in March 2012.  The Insurance Council of Australia estimates the 2011 damage at $2.38 billion with an estimated total reserve of $3.71 billion. Further payouts will be made to claimants for progress payments for rebuilding and business interruption. The insurance costs totalled $1.33 billion for Cyclone Yasi.",
                        "Cyclone Yasi developed as a tropical low north-west of Fiji on 29 January 2011. On 30 January, it was named Yasi by the Fiji Meteorological Service. On 2 February, it was upgraded to a Category 5 system and made landfall near Mission Beach (138 km south of Cairns) between midnight and 1 am (AEST) early on Thursday 3 February. It weakened to a tropical low near Mount Isa around 10 pm on 3 February.  In response to warnings about the expected severity of the cyclone, and possible storm surges, approximately 10,000 northern Queenslanders living in low-lying areas evacuated to more than 100 official evacuation centres. Significant numbers were accommodated in unofficial evacuation centres established by communities and church groups. Thousands of people left the area and sought refuge with family and friends.  Flights out of the region were fully booked. The entire hospital population, more than 300 patients, were evacuated to other regional hospitals and Brisbane by the the Australian Defence Force, Royal Flying Doctor Service and other methods.&amp;nbsp; This was an unprecedented evacuation effort.  The eye of the cyclone passed over Dunk Island and Mission Beach between Innisfail and Townsville bringing significant winds, the highest estimated at 285 km per hour. Considerable damage occurred to the towns of Tully, Cardwell, Tully Heads, Innisfail, Ingham, Mission Beach, El Arish, Silkwood and Silky Oak and localities, however, the cyclone&amp;rsquo;s worst impact missed the major centres of Townsville and Cairns. Overall, approximately 1000 people reported significant damage to their homes. Other impacts include power loss to more than 200,000 properties, cars were found metres away from where they were left and boats were piled on top of each other in some regions.  Rainfall totals for the 24 hour period to 9 am Thursday 3 February were 200-300 mm in the area between Cairns and Ayr, causing some flooding. A 5 m tidal surge was observed at the storm tide gauge at Cardwell. Other sea inundation occurred between the beaches north of Cairns and Alva Beach, and there was some inundation in parts of the city of Townsville.  The Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics and Sciences estimated the cyclone caused a $300 million hit to agriculture, particularly affecting banana and sugarcane crops.  The Federal Government processed over $250 million worth of recovery grants in the first three weeks after the storm through Centrelink. Financial help was also available in the form of concessional loans for cyclone hit farmers up to $650,000.  There was one recorded death.  The Insurance Council of Australia estimated the preliminary 2011 damage at $1412 million.",
                        "On 4 February 2011, severe thunderstorms developed over Victoria. Tropical moisture associated with Tropical Cyclone Anthony and ex Tropical Cyclone Yasi interacted with a persistent low pressure trough extending from central Australia, through Mildura and Melbourne, to north-eastern Tasmania.  Extremely high humidity and strong winds were associated with the storms which delivered record daily and multi-day rainfall totals to areas of north-east and south-east Victoria. The rain caused flash flooding in metropolitan Melbourne and prompted flood warnings for 24 rivers and creeks.  On the afternoon and evening of 4 February, a damaging microburst caused damage west of Melbourne at Laverton. Wind speed strengthened from calm to 131 km per hour in six&amp;nbsp;minutes causing damage to vegetation and structures within an area of approximately one square kilometre.  More than 65 per cent of Victoria recorded daily rainfall totals in the 99th percentile for February in the 24 hours to 9 am on February 5. Approximately 7 per cent of the State observed the highest daily rainfall on record on the same day and 40 stations throughout Victoria recorded multi-day rainfall totals over 140 mm between 4 and 6 February.  Nursing home residents were evacuated from Mentone, Narre Warren and Werribee, whilst the Koo Wee Rup and the Alfred hospital relocated patients.  Emergency relief centres were opened in Mildura, Narre Warren, Cardinia, Pakenham and Swan Hill.  State wide, more than 6000 calls were made to the Victorian State Emergency Service.

The heaviest rain spread into Victoria, resulting in record rainfall in parts of west and north-west Victoria. This, combined with saturated conditions of the catchment and floodplains, caused severe flooding.  Jeparit recorded the highest daily rainfall of 161.2 mm, with seven other monitoring stations breaking their highest daily rainfall records. Weather stations at Kyneton, Annuello, Rupanyup and Maryborough observed their highest ever rainfall total for anymonth on record.  The Wimmera, Avoca, Loddon and Campaspe river catchment areas all reached record flood peaks. The Barwon catchment and the Lerderderg River in the Werribee catchment also experienced major flooding. The towns of Charlton, Bridgewater, Carisbrook, Rochester, Horsham and Echuca experienced the greatest levels of inundation.  The flooding of the Goulburn River resulted in the drowning of a person&amp;nbsp;in a flooded billabong near Shepparton.

Queensland recorded the highest state wide average rainfall on 2 March, with 31.74 mm, exceeding the previous record of 31.49 mm established on 21 May 1981.  As a result the heavy deluge brought about widespread flooding to numerous rivers including Paroo, Moonie, Balonne, Dawson, Theodore, Moura, Maranoa, Warrego, Diamantina, Bulloo, Condamine, Weir, Mary, Burnett, and Comet. This had devastating impact on infrastructure including roads, railways and bridges, as well as agriculture and horticulture industries including farms, crops and live stock.

During 1992-1993 there was some improvement in conditions where rain fell but this was inconsistent and often short-lived. In early 1994 the drought extended significantly affecting most of New South Wales and Victoria, encroaching on southern South Australia the south and west of Western Australia and north-eastern Tasmania.  As 1994 went on, the drought steadily worsened; by September 1994, about 83 per cent of New South Wales and 40 per cent of Queensland were drought declared.  In September 1994, the Commonwealth announced a total drought assistance package assessed to total $164 million over two years. Over the course of this drought average rural production fell by over 10 per cent and rural unemployment rose. Loss to the economy is estimated at around $5 billion.",

                        "Cyclone Steve formed in the northern Coral Sea, near Willis Island, and developed into a cyclone at approximately 7 am on 27 February 2000. The cyclone intensified further during the day to reach Category 2 intensity by 1 pm, before crossing the east Queensland coast to the near north of Cairns at approximately 7 pm.  Cyclone Steve caused major flooding between Cairns and Mareeba. A record flood level of 12.4 m was reached at Mareeba at 4.37 am on 28 February 2000, with 90 people requiring evacuation and the railway bridge washed away. Many buildings in Cairns suffered severe water damage including the Cairns Hospital. Wind gusts of up to 150 km per hour caused several buildings in Cairns and Kuranda to lose their roofs. Hundreds of trees were uprooted and powerlines were brought down throughout the district, disrupting supplies to more than 40,000 residents. The two highways to the Atherton Tablelands were closed by fallen trees and landslides. Crop damage by floods and winds was severe, notably the sugar cane industry.  Cairns Emergency Services answered over 1200 calls during the course of Cyclone Steve, while the Disaster Coordination Centre took another 1800 calls. One person from the town of Cardwell was killed by the floods following the cyclone.  The Insurance Council of Australia estimated the 2000 damage at $11 million, with the 2011 estimated normalised cost of $31 million.  NOTE: This is the cost and summary for Queensland exclusively; Cyclone Steve also impacted on Northern Territory and Western Australia.",

This caused water to rise approximately 1.5 m in the centre of the town, damaging most shops. The severe storm was a result of an off shore low pressure system that was strengthened by the steep ranges of Coffs Harbour.  Coffs Creek flooded, which was intensified by the high tide. One person drowned, having been swept away by the rising flood water.  Approximately 300 people were moved to higher ground due to inundation.

                        "On 4 April 1989, Cyclone Aivu crossed the North Queensland coast near the Burdekin River between Townsville and Bowen.  On 31 March a tropical low developed south-east of Papua New Guinea. It moved slowly west-southwest and the system deepened reaching tropical cyclone intensity on 1 April. Cyclone Aivu tracked south-east and then south-west at 15-20 km per hour and continued to intensify for some days. The cyclone then weakened but maintained severe tropical cyclone intensity when reaching land south of Townsville. Upon reaching the land, the central pressure was 957 hPa with wind gusts to 200 km per hour and a storm surge of up to 3 m. A person drowned in the accompanying storm surge south of the Burdekin River. The system continued to move west-southwest after landfall and degenerated into a rain depression during the next six hours losing identity two days later.  Cyclone Aivu produced record and near record April rainfall totals over large parts of the coastal and central interior districts of Queensland and some parts of New South Wales. The maximum total recorded rainfalls inland from Mackay over 24 hours were 581 mm. Severe local flooding occurred between Townsville and Mackay during 4 April with a flood peak at Mackay of 7.8 m on 5 April; the major flood peak measured 13.2 m on the Pioneer River upstream from Mackay.  In northern New South Wales, flooding occurred as a result of this cyclone and two people drowned in associated flood waters.

                        "On 27 November heavy rainfall occurred in the northern inland areas of New South Wales. Flood warnings were issued for the Macleay, Severn, Macintyre, Gwydir, Mehi, Namoi and Peel Rivers.New South Wales State Emergency Service volunteers prepared Wee Waa with food and emergency supplies, with predictions that the swollen Namoi River would isolate the town for some days. The rising waters made the roads in Wee Waa inaccessible to all but four-wheel drive vehicles. Water levels exceeded 6 m around 9:00 am on 27 November, before reaching 7 m on 29 November with major flooding.  Approximately 300 properties were isolated in Moree, and the town was cut in two after rising waters forced the closure of the local bridge.More properties were cut off in Gunnedah and the village of Garah, as waters in the Namoi, Gwydir, Peel and Mehi Rivers continued to rise. One person drowned after being pulled into a storm water drain in Bingara, near Inverell.  As the flood waters abated and moved downstream, the Department of Primary Industries were able to assess the flood damage. Hundreds of livestock, mainly sheep, died with most of the losses occurring between Garah and Weemelah. Fodder drops will continue to provide quality feed.  It has been estimated that approximately $52 million in flood damage has occurred to the cotton industry in the Gwydir Valley. The local growers&#39; association says initial estimates are based on around 18,000 hectares; up to 30 per cent of the dryland crop and five per cent of irrigated crop being damaged. It warns these figures could worsen as the floodwaters move downstream inundating more cotton and upstream crops begin to emerge.  On 1 December 2011, the New South Wales Government announced natural disaster declarations following the recent heavy rain and significant flooding in Northern New South Wales; local councils involved include Moree Plains, Inverell, Armidale, Gunnedah, Narrabri, Gwydir, Muswellbrook, Liverpool Plains, Tamworth and the Upper Hunter Shire Councils.",

                        "On 21 December 2011 a tropical low formed within an active monsoon trough over the Arafura Sea, north of the Top End in the Northern Territory. During 23-24 December, the tropical low began intensifying and at 3.30 am on Christmas Day the tropical low was named Tropical Cyclone Grant, approximately 60 km north of the Cobourg Peninsula.  Tropical Cyclone Grant intensified to a category 2 tropical cyclone at 3.30 pm and made landfall on the Cobourg Peninsula at 9 pm.  Tropical Cyclone Grant weakened rapidly once over land and was downgraded to below tropical cyclone intensity at 12.30 pm on 26 December, approximately 30 km north-west of Jabiru.  The Cyclone reached a maximum sustained wind speed of 100 km per hour, a maximum wind gust of 140 km per hour and a lowest central pressure of 978 hPa. Grant caused torrential rainfall over parts of the Cobourg Peninsula and the adjacent north coast of the Arnhem district.  Many trees were brought down in the community of Minjilang on the Cobourg Peninsula and the surrounding outstations and power supply was interrupted. Coastal erosion and minor flooding of low lying coastal areas was reported between the Cobourg Peninsula and Nhulunbuy due to spring tides, larger than usual swell and strong onshore monsoonal winds.  Overnight on 26 December and during the early morning of 27 December heavy rainfall occurred over the Edith, Cullen and Fergusson River Catchments, including 385 mm at Edith River Falls in the 24 hours to 9 am on 27 December, resulting in flash flooding along those rivers.  A rapid river rise damaged the Edith River railway bridge, causing a 20 wagon freight train to derail while crossing over it. The train was carrying 1500 tonnes of copper concentrate from OZ Minerals&#39; Prominent Hill copper mine in South Australia when it derailed and up to 1200 tonnes of the substance spilled into the Edith River.  The copper concentrate from Oz Minerals&#39; mine contains less than 0.008 per cent of uranium, which equates to 96 kg in 1200 tonnes of copper concentrate. Northern Territory Environment Department Chief Executive Jim Grant said copper concentrate is an&amp;nbsp;environmental hazard and a threat to aquatic life, but that although it contains arsenic and silica it is not rated as highly toxic.  The two drivers of the crash were airlifted to Katherine for treatment of minor injuries and the 200 passengers on board were temporarily stranded.  Significant damage was also made to the Stuart Highway rendering it impassable for two to three days.  Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements (NDRRA) assistance was made available for the Local Government Areas of West Arnhem Shire, East Arnhem Shire, Katherine Municipality, Roper Gulf Shire, and Victoria Daly Shire.",

It departed from Circular Quay, Sydney harbour for Watsons Bay at 4.15 pm on 3 November 1927 with an estimated 120 passengers on board.  At approximately 4.45 pm the Greycliffe veered to port, not realising that the 140 m, 7700 ton luxury passenger liner and mail ship RMS Tahiti was 100 m behind it. The Tahiti was travelling at a speed of 12 knots, and with such a small distance between the two vessels it was too late for the Tahiti to change direction or stop.  The Tahiti collided with the Greycliffe, rolling it over and cleaving it in two. The superstructure collapsed and many were killed by the hull and propellers as they ploughed through the ferry.  The Greycliffe&#39;s boiler imploded on contact with the cold water and the ship began to sink. Many went down with it. The collision caused the deaths of 40 people, including six children returning home from school.  On 8 January 1928 the Court of Marine Inquiry found the captain on the Tahiti responsible for the collision due to failure to observe harbour regulations and travelling approximately four knots over the speed limit. He was suspended from service.  The Coronial Inquiry, conducted concurrently with the Court of marine Inquiry, however found both captains negligent but not criminally so.  The Admiralty Court found that the major initiator of the incident was the turn of the Greycliffe without warning, observation or care. The court found that both parties were negligent but the Greycliffe held three fifths of the negligence as its turn was greater than reasonable or necessary.  On March 1990 an appeal in the Full Court upheld the decision of the Admiralty Court, however giving more negligence to the Captain of the Greycliffe with two thirds responsibility.  No consensus was formed over the cause of the collision.",

Three hundred and fifty-three people drowned and 45 survived after being rescued by Indonesian fishing boats. SIEV X had been sailing for over 24 hours when it sank.  A Senate Committee Inquiry was held into the sinking of SIEV X.&amp;nbsp; The Committee addressed the question whether or not Australian authorities had sufficient intelligence to launch a search and rescue operation either prior to or immediately after the vessel foundered.In summary, the Committee found that there had recently been reports of large increases in the numbers of asylum seeking boats leaving Indonesia for Australia which resulted in increased intelligence to monitor and analyse.  Additionally intelligence analysts had trouble deciphering the legitimacy of such intelligence due to unreliable sources, uneven quality and often contradictory details that were difficult to corroborate.&amp;nbsp; This led to wariness to make decisions based on unsubstantiated information.  The Senate Committee found that the quality and detail of information and intelligence available to the authorities was insufficient to have warranted the launching of a specific search and rescue operation and therefore could not find grounds for claims of negligence or dereliction of duty in relation to SIEV X. However the Committee was surprised that such an event could go unnoticed in an area where Australian surveillance operations were underway until three days after the event.",

Four tourists were seriously injured and more than 20 others were hospitalised.The tourists, mostly from Armidale New South Wales, were on a 32 day eco-tour of north-western England and Scotland organised by Euroview Coaches of Dereham. Representatives from the Australian High Commission arrived on the scene the following day.",
                        "Rainfall occurring from 14 February 1863 resulted in the Macleay River rising quickly and by 16 February the water level was 19-20 ft above its ordinary level at East Kempsey. Large trees, driftwood and debris rushed down the river and inundated crops, sheds and residences, isolating many homes. Twelve people fled the area in a boat and nine subsequently drowned.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  On 23 February, further north in the ranges between Queensland and New South Wales, torrential rain brought huge volumes of water down into the Clarence River. The police barracks at Tabulam were completely submerged then washed away. A local policeman was drowned after being trapped in the flood waters.",
                        "The Maitland was an iron paddle steamer that undertook a regular passage between Sydney and Newcastle, often travelling overnight. On the night of 5-6 May 1898 the steamer left Sydney and struck the full force of a great storm that eventually led to the loss of the Maitland near Cape Three Points. Reports vary of the loss of life, but of the 63 crew and passengers on board around 21 - 26 people died. &amp;nbsp;The storm and the enormous seas caused considerable damage to the steamer. The cargo on the deck broke loose making holes near the paddle wheels and huge seas washed over board and extinguished the boiler fires, leaving the Maitland helpless. Passengers were assembled in the saloon, issued with life belts and warned that the vessel wouldn&amp;rsquo;t stay afloat for long. At 5.45 am it swept onto rocks and broke in two, the fore section was rolled over and over by the giant waves, drowning most of the steerage passengers in the forepart of the ship. After several attempts a line was secured to the shore enabling most of the passengers and crew to reach safety through the huge waves.",
                        "Between 10 -14 March 2011, the central and eastern Kimberley regions of Western Australia experienced extremely heavy rainfall, with more than 700 mm falling during the month over the Kimberley Plateau, caused by an active monsoon trough. A further slow moving tropical low caused extensive flood damage to infrastructure across the Fitzroy, Ord and Pentecost River catchments areas.  A number of towns in the Kimberley region broke their highest March rainfall records including Warmun, Yulmbu and Gibb River.  In the east Kimberley town of Warmun up to 500 people were evacuated when the town&#39;s 76 houses were either destroyed or deemed uninhabitable through flood inundation.&amp;nbsp;Within days more than 290 members of the Warmun community were evacuated to the Ord Stage II Camp (Garrjang) in Kununurra.  The Western Australian state government immediately pledged the initial sum of $500,000 to contribute toward the rebuilding of the town. The state government further contributed $15 million to construct a 200 bed temporary accommodation for the community. The federal government committed to reimburse 50 per cent of the cost through the National Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements.&amp;nbsp;  The Department of Housing allocated $9.5 million to repair the damaged roads and create new roads to the newly built replacement homes. The town also received more than $8 million from the federal government to help with recovery. The funding would be provided over two years under the Community Development Employment Projects program. Funds were allocated towards projects to enhance the economic and social development of the community, such as rebuilding and creating opportunities for locals to develop work skills to contribute to their community.  The Insurance Council of Australia did not provide insurance loss figures for this event. In terms of government spend on recovery certainly more than $10 million was spent on the flood.",
                        "In early January 2013 up to 40 fires were burning throughout Tasmania in hot windy conditions. The main fire that started near Forcett caused significant damage to local townships, particularly Dunalley, east of Hobart, where more than half of the town&amp;rsquo;s buildings and a primary school were destroyed. Other significant fire fronts were located at Lake Repulse and Bicheno.  The Forcett fire was first reported in bushland outside the town heading towards Dunalley, on Thursday 3 January 2013 at approximately 2.00 pm. The fire escaped containment lines the following afternoon fanned by strong winds and burned towards the coast at several points. More than 100 properties were destroyed and 2500 hectares of land were burnt by the afternoon of 6 January. At least 80 properties were either damaged or destroyed in Dunalley and nearby Boomer Bay, approximately 20 houses were destroyed at Murdunna and 40 per cent of structures were lost at Connelly&amp;rsquo;s Marsh. The fire threatened the town of Taranna and on 14 January 2013 a Victorian volunteer firefighter was killed when undertaking back burning operations in the vicinity. An estimated 24,000 hectares were burnt in the fire and at its peak the perimeter of the fire approximated 200 km.  Thousands of locals and tourists were stranded as a result of the Forcett bushfire which effectively cut the Tasman Peninsula off from the rest of the state. The peninsula&#39;s main access road, the Arthur Highway, was closed from 4&amp;nbsp;to 13 January. People converged on Port Arthur to await evacuation by sea or road and due to shortages of food and other supplies, the community arranged for a fleet of boats to make deliveries to those stranded on the peninsula. Two private catamaran operators in Hobart were asked by police to help evacuate people from the Nubeena jetty.&amp;nbsp; Evacuees were then taken to Hobart where they were met by relatives and friends or taken in by volunteers.  The Highway was partially opened on 11 January to allow stranded people and supplies to get through and was eventually opened to general traffic on 13 January.  Community refuges were established at the Sorrell Memorial Hall, Nubeena Community Centre, Bicheno Community Hall and Swansea Football Ground. There was also a Recovery Centre established at City Hall, Hobart.  The electricity company, Aurora, reported approximately 300 electricity poles were destroyed on the Tasman Peninsula, consequently power outages are expected to be an issue for a considerable time.  Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payments were made available to residents in the south-east and east of Tasmania, covering the affected local government areas of Sorell, Tasman and Glamorgan-Spring Bay. Other grants made available were immediate cash assistance grants, housing assistance grants, Aurora energy assistance and clean-up and assistance grants. A first stage recovery payment from the Red Cross Appeal Distribution Committee was distributed, providing $3000 per adult and $1000 per child by late January. The Department of Human Services has allocated over $7,845,000&amp;nbsp;to cover approximately 6900 claims.  The Insurance Council of Australia advised as at 1 February 2013 that 1783 insurance claims had been received with losses estimated at $86.7 million, about 85 per cent of these related to property, seven per cent for domestic vehicles, with the balance consisting of smaller claims for other losses.  The fire at Lake Repulse burnt more than 12,000 hectares and threatened the towns of Ellendale Ouse, Karanja, Westerway and Hamilton. Police allege it was started by an unattended campfire. The fire burnt for up to two weeks and was handed back to regional firefighters when conditions eventually improved. The other significant fire front was at Bicheno and Coles Bay where up to 15 properties were lost.  These fires were described as the worst in almost half a century. On 14 January a Tasmanian Bushfire Recovery Taskforce was established and the state moved to recovery mode. The taskforce estimated that rebuilding communities could take up to two years, with contractors expected to start clearing damaged properties by the end of January.  Further information will be provided about the Tasmanian fires and resulting damage when available.",
                        "During January 2013, New South Wales experienced very challenging fire danger weather conditions resulting in multiple fires across the state. By 8 January, there were over 100 fires burning, fueled by 40 degree Celsius temperatures.&amp;nbsp;  The worst fire occured on 13 January when a fast moving bushfire in the Warrumbungle National Park near Coonabarabran destroyed more than 51 nearby homes and damaged many others. The lodge at the Siding Spring Observatory in the National Park was damaged along with other buildings. However, Australia&#39;s largest telescope the Anglo-Australian survived.  The other major areas affected by fire were Yass, Cooma and the Shoalhaven. One house was destroyed in Jugiong and a volunteer firefighter sustained burn injuries in Gundaroo and was airlifted to Sydney for hospital treatment.  A recovery centre was opened in Coonabarabran after the fire. A recovery coordinator was appointed on 21 January by Barry O&amp;rsquo;Farrell concentrating on supporting the Warrumbungles fire affected community.  Approximately 131,000 hectares were burnt in total across the state and extensive farm infrastructure and fences damaged. Approximately 12,000 sheep were lost at an estimated cost of over $1,000,000. Wildlife losses were also significant. The Department teamed with farmers to establish a fodder and fencing donation register to assist farmers rebuilding after the fires.  On 15 January, the New South Wales Premier, Barry O&#39;Farrell, and the Federal Minister for Emergency Management, Nicola Roxon, announced Natural Disaster Assistance would be available to 51 Local Government Areas in New South Wales affected by bushfires. To date the Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payments were $1,015,600 for over 830 claimants.  The Insurance Council of Australia declared the Coonabarabran bushfire a catastrophe and as of March 2013, estimated damages costing $35 million.  &amp;nbsp;",
                        "From 24 March to 29 March oysters harvested and sold out of lease 113 near Dunalley&amp;nbsp;south of Hobart contained a norovirus that caused an outbreak of gastroenteritis. Authorities removed the oysters from sale on 31 March after up to 60 people initially presented with gastroenteritis symptoms in Tasmania and investigations commenced.  The Public and Environmental Health Service of Tasmania advised that the source of the oyster contamination was a private sewage line nearby at Dunalley. Once the contamination source was identified a temporary closure of other small oyster harvest zones further out to sea occurred as a precaution pending further test results.  The volume of sewage leaking from the pipe was very low, and the leaking underground pipe was capped while the owner carried out repairs. Investigations confirmed oyster lease 113 was the only source of the oysters causing illness, affecting people interstate and in Tasmania.  Health authorities estimated approximately 100 Tasmanians and up to 80 Victorians contracted gastroenteritis after eating the oysters at Easter, with some requiring hospitalisation for hydration purposes.",
                        "On 21 March 2013, at approximately 8 pm, a category F3 tornado with winds between 250 km per hour and 300 km per hour crossed north-east Victoria up to the border of New South Wales, impacting Koonoomoo, Rutherglen, Cobram, Yarrawonga, Bundalong, Euroa and Mulwala.  The tornado lasted only five minutes, but in this time the wind caused considerable destruction. Roofs were lifted off houses, caravans were overturned and some commercial buildings were severely damaged including the Cobram Barooga Golf Club, several historic buildings in the main street of Rutherglen, two caravan parks, a car dealership and a winery.  Approximately 24 people were injured, many from flying debris during the tornado. Four people were airlifted to Melbourne by Ambulance Victoria with serious injuries while others were treated locally in hospitals such as Yarrawonga where the local motels were utilised to ensure enough beds for patients.  The State Emergency Service received approximately 150 calls for assistance during this period, most requiring help with fallen trees blocking roads or damaging houses. The Hume Freeway, near Benalla, and the Murray Valley Highway at Bundalong were forced to close for a period of time until fallen trees were cleared. Disruptions occurred to local power and telecommunications services.  Approximately fifteen homes were deemed uninhabitable in Koonoomoo, seven in Bundalong and two in Rutherglen. Fourteen properties were badly damaged in Bundalong and 19 other properties sustained damaged across the region. It is estimated over 100 caravans were damaged by the wind.  Orchards and vineyards across Mulwala, Yarrawonga, Bundalong, Koonoomoo and Rutherglen were also impacted by the tornado. One peach grower in Koonoomoo had 2000 fruit trees flattened by the winds, causing damage in excess of $100,000.  The federal and state governments agreed to provide emergency financial assistance for those affected by the tornadoes. Recovery efforts were hindered by scattered debris, for example, in some locations there are sheets of iron high up trees and asbestos has been uncovered in the damage.  The Insurance Council of Australia stated it is unlikely to declare the incident a catastrophe, based on the damage evidenced to date.  Further information will be provided when available.",
                        "On 13 August 1940, a RAAF Lockheed bomber crashed near Canberra, killing all ten people on board. The plane was bringing Ministers and high officers from Melbourne to Canberra for a cabinet meeting. It was preparing to land at Canberra when it nose-dived into a hill, hitting a large log in the middle of the clearing.  Witnesses at the aerodrome watched the plane lose height above low hills about three miles from the landing strip. It appeared that one engine faltered and the plane immediately tipped on one wing and disappeared from view behind a clump of trees.  The plane crashed on the top of a hill in a small clearing between two trees. The machine was enveloped in flames when police, ambulance officers and aircraftsmen reached the scene.  Among those killed were three Commonwealth Ministers from then-Prime Minister Menzies&amp;rsquo; Government and the Chief of the Australian General Staff.",
                        "A cluster of tornados hit towns within Queensland&amp;rsquo;s Bundaberg Region on 26 January, 2013. They were caused by warm unstable east to north-easterly winds feeding into ex-tropical cyclone Oswald, which formed in the Gulf of Carpentaria on 21 January.  The first tornado hit Bargara at about 1pm, bringing down powerlines, tearing off roofs and flinging iron and windows across the streets. A disaster was declared in this area. Burnett Heads, just north of Bargara, was impacted at about 3pm with a third tornado ripping through Coonarr soon after. Bungadoo, around 40km south southwest of Bundaberg was hit just after 4pm and the fifth tornado struck again at Burnett Heads about 6.21pm, damaging the roofs of two homes and several power lines.  A technical forecaster from the Bureau of Meteorology said they were not mini, but rather proper tornados, which had brought down power lines and caused major damage to shopping centres.  At least 20 people were injured, two seriously when a Norfolk pine crashed the cabin of the ute they were sitting in.",
                        "From late December 2012 to early January 2013, Australia experienced a nationwide heatwave. Temperatures peaked throughout Australia, forcing the Bureau of Meteorology to add new colours (deep purple and pink) to its weather forecasting chart to record temperatures above 50&amp;deg;C.  Australia&amp;rsquo;s first six days of 2013 were among the hottest 20 days on record in terms of average maximums. The heatwave developed over a large region stretching from northern Victoria and inland New South Wales to central-west Queensland, across to north-western Western Australia and down to the Nullarbor coast.The national average maximum across Australia on 7 January was 40.33 &amp;deg;C, beating the previous record set in 1972 by 0.16&amp;deg;C.  In Perth, temperatures exceeded 37&amp;deg;C for seven consecutive days. This heatwave caused 20 people to be hospitalised between the period 27 December and 3 January. St John Ambulance reported a doubling in call-outs for heatstroke, dehydration and burns from the previous week. On New Year&amp;rsquo;s Eve, Western Australia recorded 42.1 &amp;deg;C, 13 &amp;deg;C above the December average. The state&#39;s average temperature for the last week of 2012 averaged a maximum of 39.3 &amp;deg;C, making it the hottest week in 80 years.&amp;nbsp;Records were broken in Alice Springs, with temperatures over 40 &amp;deg;C for 17 days in a row and Oodnadatta, where temperatures exceeded 45 &amp;deg;C for seven consecutive days.  On 17, January Sydney endured its hottest day ever, with a record temperature of 45.8 &amp;deg;C. The Ambulance Service of New South Wales reported that more than 220 people had been treated for heat exposure or fainting. The heatwave stranded thousands of commuters, with dozens of trains delayed as steel wires buckled and a hose used to run a key signalling system melted. On the central coast, the heat caused an overhead wire to buckle onto a train at approximately 1.30 pm, trapping about 250 passengers for half an hour.  There was a noted increase in nationwide hospital admissions for kidney disease, acute renal failure and heart attacks across this period. The Bureau of Meteorology stated the heatwave was an exceptional event.",

                        "The bushfire began in the Perth Hills on Sunday morning 12 January 2014 during the heatwave of 8 -13 January with consecutive days over 40 degrees Celsius. The excessive heat and strong winds fuelled the fire which quickly grew out of control and spread from Parkerville to Stoneville and Mount Helena. A total of 650 hectares were burnt.  Hundreds of people were evacuated from their homes and sought shelter at centres set up in Mundaring and Swan View. Many residents were unable to return and assess the damage to their homes until 15 January when the extensive clean-up of debris and fallen power poles was complete. As of 16 January, 450 homes were still without electricity. It is believed that the fire was started by a fallen power pole.  A man died on the Sunday while protecting his home.  Financial assistance and grants were made to eligible Perth Hills bushfire victims, with Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payments of $384,800 scheduled to be paid.  The West Australian government gave $1 million to the Lord Mayor&amp;rsquo;s Disaster Appeal and announced anyone who lost their house would receive $3000 and those whose homes were damaged would&amp;nbsp;receive $1000.  Early figures from the Insurance Council of Australia suggest $15 million damage. Further details will be provided as they become available.",
                        "&amp;nbsp;On 15 January 2014, a bushfire which was sparked by a lightning strike started in the Grampians National Park. It was one of 68 fires burning across Victoria during this time.  The fire coincided with a heatwave across Victoria with temperatures reaching over 40 C in the Grampians region from 15 - 20 January. The fire eventually burnt 52,000 hectares including bushland and farms and was declared contained on 21 January 2014. Many residents from Dadswell&amp;rsquo;s Gap, Wartook, Brimpean, St Helen&amp;rsquo;s Plain, Roses Gap Pomonal, Bellfield, Lake Fyans, Lake Lonsdale, Heatherlie and Ledcourt were affected by the fires. Halls Gap was threatened by the fire front and ember attack and most of the town evacuated. Relief centres were set up in Horsham, Stawell and Ararat for the hundreds of people who were evacuated from their homes. Farmers lost large numbers of sheep that were either killed by the fire or later culled. At least 7000 sheep in total were lost.  A 12 km wide pyro cumulus cloud column of smoke and fire was created by the fire, generating its own weather pattern including lightning and thunder. This cloud gathered burning embers into the sky, which then scattered for many kilometres beyond the fire front, potentially starting new fires.  Once the fire was contained, emergency services began assisting people to return to their homes and cleaning up the tourist attractions in time for visitors to be able to come to the Grampians National Park over the Australia Day long weekend.  Financial assistance for people in bushfire affected communities was provided under the jointly funded Commonwealth-Victorian Natural Disaster Relief Recovery Arrangements. This included making available concessional loans for small businesses and primary producers. Local councils were also provided with funds for clean-up activities and to repair essential public assets.  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;",

The flood caused significant soil erosion, with extensive damage caused to crops and infrastructure. Homes and homesteads in the nearby towns of Carnarvon and Gascoyne Junction were flooded and the 100 year-old local pub was washed away. At least 2000 cattle drowned.  &amp;nbsp;  Western Australia&amp;rsquo;s Department of Agriculture and Food estimated the damage to be $90 million."
